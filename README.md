# BuyEase

## Motivation
BuyEase is a marketplace platform specifically designed for university students to buy and sell goods and services within their campus community. The platform addresses the challenge of finding trusted, local buyers and sellers for items such as textbooks, electronics, and services like tutoring. By creating a secure and convenient platform for students, BuyEase fosters community interactions and helps students save money by purchasing second-hand goods or accessing affordable services. It also enables student entrepreneurs to sell their products or skills.
